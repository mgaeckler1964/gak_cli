GAK_CLI was originaly implemented on an Atari ST computer in 1988 as a command line interpreter and a set of useful tools.
Most of the tools worked like their counterparts in MS-DOS and were compiled with Turbo C from Heimsoeth & Borland, the company in Munich I was working for in these times. 
The cli and many of these tools are no longer under development, but there are new useful tools here.

Here is a list of commands:

*aes*

analyse a WAV-file and find clipings

*dlink*

*dupMails*
read all mbox files and search for duplicate mails

*head*
like unix head
